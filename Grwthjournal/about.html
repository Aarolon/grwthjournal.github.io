						<h2>About Grwth</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Grwth was originally founded from the struggles of a close friend. They were facing a tough time in their life, affected severely by depression and anxiety. What got them out of this, was journaling. But it took time and a strong desire to overcome their struggle. This made them believe there could be a better solution to what their original problem was, knowing how to journal in a way that most positively impacted their mental health while also keeping them engaged.
						This is where Grwth comes in. By using machine learning models with professional counseling and therapy based analyses to create structured prompts relative to a user’s needs, the guidance our friend desired to both keep them engaged and to support their mental health improvement was finally real.
						Mental health affects us all, and pressures such as high workload or balancing roles and relationships can really put a strain on our mental health. This can lead to many prevalent mental health problems

					<h3>About the Team</h3>
					<p>
						Our current team of three spans a range of backgrounds and experiences.
						Before Grwth, Mike was a tech consultant focused on leading & managing large scale enterprise software implementations at Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies. As helping corporate conglomerates improve their margins and drive top-line growth did not translate to meaningful impact, he decided to make a career change into the world of startups.
						Torin is a senior majoring in computer science at the Colorado School of Mines with previous venture investment experience at Rockies Venture Club. He is also the president of the entrepreneurship club on campus as well as a University Innovation Fellow with future plans for a masters in computer science with emphasis on machine learning.
						Kenny is a business analytics sophomore at the University of Denver, also with plans for a masters - but in data science. Both Torin & Kenny have previous experience in mental health as they have held various positions as peer mentors & educators at their respective school’s counseling center and thus have first hand experience
